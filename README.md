# FM2K Controls
A little application written in C# for editing the controller inputs of FM2K. If you have any knowledge on C#, then you're welcome to help with development!

# How to contribute
You need to have installed the following:

- Visual Studio 2017 (Latest Update).

# Issue Reporting & Other
The only way to inject plug-ins at the moment is through FM2K's unused WSOCK32.dll. This is obviously limiting, but hopefully this interface will make it a lot easier.

If you find something broken or not working correctly, open an issue in the Issues tab and we'll get straight to fixing it!
